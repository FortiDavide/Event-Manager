<h1>Event-Manager</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This plugin is intended to help server administrators manage various events for the<br>
players on their server.</p>

<h3>Commands</h3>
<p><b>/event create [name]</b>: Create an event with the name entered instead of [name]</p>
<p><b>/event join [name]</b>: Puts the user on the list of people participating in the event</p>
<p><b>/event leave [name]</b>: Remove the user from the list of people participating in the event</p>
<p><b>/event start [name]</b>: Teleports all users to the coordinates of the person who launched the command</p>

<p><b>event.disband</b>: Op-Only</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

Always remember to disband an event to avoid server RAM problems.</p>
